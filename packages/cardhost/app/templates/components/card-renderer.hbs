This stuff that is wrapping the card components is just throw-away scaffolding.
Feel free to get rid of it as soon as it no longer makes sense.

    TODO this component should be responsible for deciding which format of the card to render.
    The process of rendering a card is fundamentally async as we'll need to load the card data,
    as well as waiting for the card component to be compiled by embroider. Make sure to build in
    Ember Concurrency into the rendering of the card component here.
