    {{!-- Changing the parent card is not yet really supported in new-hub.
    It can technically happen, be we haven't put in place all the guardrails
    to effectively migrate your card's data into a different card type if
    there are field conflicts. And changing the parent card of your card to
    the base card, specifically, seems unuseful if there is not yet a way to
    set more specific card as your parent as a second step. it will be a
    bunch of engineering work for questionable user benefit. Let's just
    hold off until we can do the actual thing here.
