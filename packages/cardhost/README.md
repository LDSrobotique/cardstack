# cardhost

The cardhost is an application container that hosts cards. The cardhost is deployed as a stand-alone ember application outside of the mono repo. Because the cardhost is deployed as an isolated module outside of the mono repo, ***if any of it's mono repo peer modules change, you'll need to rev the mono repo in order for the deployed cardhost to pick up the changes.***
